* fork `https://github.com/lotov/lcode3d` or its fork;
* check it out locally;
* install dependencies (see `requirements.txt`);
* verify that LCODE runs as-is;
* implement, test and commit changes;
* rebase it if the parent branch advances;
* submit a pull request;
* wait for it to be rebased-and-merged.
